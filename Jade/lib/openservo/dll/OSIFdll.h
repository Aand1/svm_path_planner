  All function return <0 for error and >0 for success
    Function arguments:
    adapter:  adapter number starting from 0
    i2c_addr: address of device on the I2C bus
    addr:     start address of data read/write
    data:     pointer to unsigned char containing read bytes/bytes to write
    buflen:   length of data to read/write
	stop_off: STOP_ON will send a stop bit after the transaction, STOP_OFF will now.
